# Prolog-project-2

Task 1:
write a recursive rule that finds 0 or more airports at immediate hops between town A to town B. It will find and print the route.

Task 2:
writes a rule myDelete(A,List1, List2) which deletes all occurences of item A from list1. and example of this would be inputting:  myDelete(b, [b,c,d,b,c,b], Result) which gives Result=[c,d,c]. Lastly, this result is written to an output file. 

Task 3:
Code for a 9x9 sudoku puzzle that can compute any given number.
